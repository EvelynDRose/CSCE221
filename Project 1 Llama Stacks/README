I know this is a weird name, but its an acronym. Llama stands for Linked-List Array Mixed Amalgamated Stack.

Each node has an array of a given size and the last node is the top of the stack.

The driver for this was one the the test drivers given to us. This driver includes the OvCoInt files (Overly Complicated Integers).

The functions for this project include:
-size() returns the size od the stack
-push() pushes to the stack
-pop() pops from the stack
-swap() swaps the top two items in the stack
-rot() rotates so that the third from the top item is at the top of the stack
-peek() returns the value of the item in a specific spot
