This project is a binary search tree. It is able to read in from an inputs.txt and places each element into a binary tree. 
This program is also able to read in a commands.txt file and exicutes said command on the search tree.

The commands include:
-NthElement() returns the value of the nth element that is in the in-order traversal
-Rank() returns the node that is in a specific index in-order traversal
-Median() returns the value median node
-IsPerfect() checks the see if the tree is a perfect tree
-PrintLevels() prints the tree level by level
-RemoveResidue() removes the excess NULL nodes from the tree when running the printlevels function. This is to make sure there are no memeory leaks.

If any errors occure whaile running the program, such as a NodeNotFound/ItemNotFound exception, it will output the errors into an errors.txt file.
